            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Well my name is Sushant Sejwal and currently I study in class 11<sup>th</sup>. This is my second
                websiteI have made with code. So, basicly in this website I have tell a little bit about my self so,
                if you wanna read then you can or leave this site because most of the people say's I am boring.</p>
            <p>when I was in 7<sup>th</sup> class in KV Hasimara my dad got transfer and we came to delhi and coming
                to delhi and I would the best thing had happen in my life. I have so much intreset in locomotives
                and especially in diesel locomotives. when I was in West Bengal I didn't know anything about
                locomotives and I also don't know what locomotives are. In delhi my dad take room near Palam Railway
                station and the distance between my house and station was about 50m and the place is like heaven for
                me. </p>

                <p>
                    In delhi I spend 2-3 hours in watching
                    locomotives. at first I was scared of locomotives because of
                    the diesel engine inside the locomotive. when I used to pass nearby them literally I always say's oh
                    my
                    god what I am doing, there is chance that the engine inside it get blast and I am dead. but I still
                    do
                    that because I liked that. </p>
                <p>I gain a lot of knowledge in palam about locomotives like, <em>what are locomotives, types of
                        locmotives, how a locomotive work, how to start a locomotive and how to drive a
                        locomotives.</em> I am not gonna explain these things, if I do this then page is going to be so
                    long.

                <p>I came in delhi in summer vacation of my school. after holidays I get addmission in KV NO.2 Delhi
                    cantt. My class was 7<sup>th</sup> A. One thing I didn't like about the school is that student used
                    to use abusive language in school and I was like <em>what the hek, is this allowed in school</em>.
                    using abusive language was not allowed in school and the thing is that you can't stop those guys.
                    the fact is that if you do complaint about those guys, they will stop for about 2-3 days and after
                    that they gonna do it again.</p>
                <p>But in the school I made some good friends and my friends were so nice and two of my freinds were my
                    best friends</p>

            <h3>8<sup>th</sup> Class</h3>
            <p>Class 8<sup>th</sup> was probably my best class. My English teacher was pooja ma'am and according to me
                ma'am was the best teacher in school. at that time only boys used to get beaten up. but for ma'am all
                students are same. One day ma'am beat me as I was talking on previous day. that was the saddest day of
                my 8<sup>th</sup> Class not because ma'am beat me but because ma'am didn't except that from me, in front
                of whole class mam told me <strong><em><q>Sushant I didn't expect this from you</q></em></strong> after
                listening this I was like oh my god what I have done. I am so bad. after that day ma'am didn't beat me
                the whole year.
            </p>
            <p>In 8<sup>th</sup> Class I was a boring guy for most of the students because I talk too much about
                locomotive, train and diesel engine related stuff. for most of the students all of these are waste,
                they're like Sushant you sucks. but one of my friend have intrest in trains, his name was Akshat but I
                have much more intrest in trains than him sometime he also get bored but only sometimes. for me
                locomotive, train and diesel engine related stuff was like awesome. many more things happen in class
                8<sup>th</sup> but I don't wanna make it long so I am stopping here. </p>

            <div class="paragraph-for-school-9-class">
                <p>In 9<sup>th</sup> Class I get intreset in more things that is Apple. The company which is the most
                    valueable company in the world. In 9<sup>th</sup> Class my dad decided to take a computer and I know
                    very less about computers, at that time I didn't even know what is android and I was thinking that
                    iPhone use windowsOS to work but that was not correct. because we need a PC so I start looking on
                    internet about PCs like, which PC is better, which will work the best and one day I saw a Apple
                    laptop the specification were only MacBook Pro 2018 and nothing other. I always thing which windows
                    is in this and later I found that Mac uses MacOS. MacOS is operating system made by Apple for his
                    computers.
                    after few months I gain a lot knowledge about computers and especially about apple. In my class I
                    talk so much about apple that my classmates say's Sushant you sucks. one time I forget to eat my
                    breakfast because I was reading a article about Apple. </p>

                only focus on quality </p>

                    I met him in class 7<sup>th</sup> when I came transfer to Delhi.
                    at first we were not good friends but at time pass we become friends. I used to go to his house
                    evrey
                    sunday at 8A.M and there we usually play cricket and some other games.
                    we both shared our personal things with each other. The happiest thing was happen in the
                    8<sup>th</sup>
                    Class, Pooja ma'am our class teacher
                    choose some students for handeling post of the class, Akshat and I become the monitor of the class.
                    he
                    was the first monitor and I was the second monitor so, most of the control of class was in our
                    hands.
                    Like me he also has intrest in Trains, sometimes we watch train videos when go to his house.
                    In september 2018 his dad leave the job and take a another job in bank in Prayagraj and that's why
                    he
                    leave the school. The day he leave the school was the saddest day of my 8<sup>th</sup> class.
                    I still remember the time we spend togther.

            <p>
                I have intrest in playing musical intsrument and especially in drums. I decided to go to our music
                teacher, then I tell him I wanna play
                musical instruments at stage so he take my test and give me permisiion to play intruments at stage and I
                met Manogya right there on the stage.
                After couple of weeks we become friends, one my another friend Anshika ask me that can I ask manogya his
                marks in English.
                I ask Manogya his marks in English and he tell me 78/80 I was like what the hek and then I ask marks of
                his others subjects and I was shocked then I get to know that he was the topper of all 8<sup>th</sup>
                section. beside this I found I good friend
                later I know he also has intrest in Apple and then later we become best friends. he shared his personel
                things with and I with him, there is like no things I hadn't tell him about me. If he has some secrets
                then he tell to me or if I had some secrets I tell to him. In 10<sup>th</sup> he leave the school
                because his dad got transfer in Tamil Nadu, the day he leave the school was probably the saddest day for
                me.
                the time we spent togther was just awesome.
